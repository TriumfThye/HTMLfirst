        <h3>If you think classic Lorem Ipsum is Old School</h3>
        
        <p>Lorem Ipsum is the classic latin passage that just never gets old. Read more about the filler text generator following the links above. 
            These days there are of course, if only for the fun of it, lots of other "Ipsums". How about a Trump Ipsum? Here is what you can get:
            "You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? 
            She's a disgusting pig, right? This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!"
            ...And so on and so forth. Triumfatics proudly presents a few articles from the Triumfatics Ipsum.</p>

                <h4>What is a penis fish?</h4>
                <P>A penis fish is neither a penis nor a fish. Urechis caupo is actually a species of spoon worm.</P>
                <p>They’re related to segmented worms like leeches and earthworms, but lost their body segments over the course of their evolution to become smooth in a way that is, frankly, unsettling.</p>
                <p>Their more polite common name is the “innkeeper worm,” due to their accidental altruism in creating tunnels that other critters can live in.</p>
                <p>Some people eat them!</p>

            <article id="six"><h4>Turning space images into music makes astronomy more accessible</h4>
                <p>Put into music, telescope observations of the center of the Milky Way create a tranquil tune, 
                glittering with xylophone and piano notes.</p>
                <p>The iconic Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula, meanwhile, sound like an eerie sci-fi score. 
                And the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A is a sweeping symphony.</p>
